                The unique identifier of the observation well.
            - latitude: float
                The latitude of the observation well location in decimal
                degrees.
            - longitude: float
                The longitude of the observation well location in decimal
                degrees.

            Optional Columns
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            - common_name: str
                The human readable name of the well.
            - municipality: str
                The municipality where the well is installed.
            - aquifer_type: str
                Indicates if the well is open in the bedrock or in the
                unconsolidated sediment.
            - confinement: str
                Indicates if the confinement at the well location is confined,
                unconfined or semi-confined,
            - aquifer_code: int
                A code that represents the combination of aquifer type and
                confinement for the well.
            - in_recharge_zone: bool
                Indicates whether the observation well is located in or in
                the proximity a recharge zone.
            - is_influenced: bool
                Indicates whether the water levels measured in that well are
                influenced or not by anthropic phenomenon.
            - elevation: float
                The elevation of the ground surface at the observation well
                location in meters above sea level.
